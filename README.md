# FED201 FRC Robot - "Stewie"

This repository contains the code for the FED201 FRC robot, named "Stewie". The robot is designed to participate in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). The code is written in Java and uses the Gradle build system.

## Features

- **Phoenix Swerewe Generator**: The robot uses the Phoenix Swerewe Generator for advanced motion control. This allows the robot to perform complex maneuvers with high precision.

- **Dual Limelight Cameras**: The robot is equipped with two Limelight cameras. One camera is used for game piece detection, while the other is used for AprilTag and distance estimation. This dual-camera setup allows the robot to effectively interact with its environment and perform tasks accurately.
